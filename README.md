# Sales_Overview_Dashboard

## Overview
I handled a business request for a detailed report and planned how to use it for future goals. I then worked on cleaning and organizing data tables needed for the report. After that, I put the refined data into Power BI and built a strong data model. This helped create a user-friendly dashboard with valuable insights from the analyzed data.

# Business request
I trust this message finds you well. We are eager to enhance our internet sales reporting system by transitioning from static reports to dynamic visual dashboards. Our goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of product sales, client engagements, and performance trends over time. As our sales team handles diverse products and clientele, the ability to filter data based on individual salespersons is crucial. To facilitate performance evaluation, we have incorporated budget comparisons for the year 2021 in a spreadsheet, adhering to our standard practice of analyzing sales trends over a two-year period. Your support in implementing these improvements would greatly contribute to our data-driven decision-making process.
